# Scala Koans Exercises

This is a git mirror of the original [Scala Koans](http://www.scalakoans.org)
Mercurial repo at https://bitbucket.org/dmarsh/scalakoansexercises.

The master branch will be kept pure, i.e. all the koans will be unsolved,
so feel free to fork and solve the koans in your own branch.
